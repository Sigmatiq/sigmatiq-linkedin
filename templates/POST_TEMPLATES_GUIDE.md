This guide explains how to customize and use the three post templates for SigmatiqAI social media content.

## üéØ Ready-to-Use Sample Posts (Examples)

We've created **3 sample post images** to demonstrate what you can create with these templates:

| Sample Image | Template Type | Theme |
|--------------|---------------|-------|
| `output/posts/monday-motivation.png` | Educational | Monday Motivation |
| `output/posts/risk-management.png` | Educational | Risk Management |
| `output/posts/beta-waitlist.png` | Announcement | Beta Testing CTA |

**Important:** These are just examples. You'll create NEW images for your actual posts by customizing the templates below.

**Relationship with SOCIAL_MEDIA_POSTS.md:**
- **SOCIAL_MEDIA_POSTS.md** = Text captions for text-only posts OR captions that accompany images
- **These Templates** = Visual image posts that pair WITH text captions or stand alone
- Many posts in SOCIAL_MEDIA_POSTS.md are text-only and don't need images
- Use these templates when you want to create eye-catching visual posts

## üìã Content Strategy: When to Use Templates vs Text-Only

### Text-Only Posts (from SOCIAL_MEDIA_POSTS.md)
Use text captions without images for:
- **Twitter/X threads** - Multi-tweet explanations work better as pure text
- **LinkedIn long-form posts** - Professional insights and thought leadership
- **Facebook detailed posts** - Community engagement and discussions
- **Quick updates** - Development updates, FAQs, simple announcements

**Examples from SOCIAL_MEDIA_POSTS.md that are text-only:**
- Post 1: Introduction (LinkedIn long-form explanation)
- Post 2: How Paper Trading Works (detailed Twitter thread)
- Post 3: Three-Step Journey (educational thread)
- Post 6: 5-Layer Safety System (Twitter thread)
- Post 7: FAQ posts

### Visual Posts (using these templates)
Create custom images when you want:
- **High visual impact** - Grab attention in feeds
- **Stand-out quotes** - Make quotes shareable
- **Brand consistency** - Show professional design
- **Instagram/visual platforms** - Required for Instagram posts
- **Highlight key messages** - Single powerful statement

**Best Template Choices:**
| Content Type | Template | When to Create | Pair With |
|--------------|----------|----------------|-----------|
| Monday Motivation | Educational | Weekly (Mondays) | Short caption from SOCIAL_MEDIA_POSTS.md |
| Trading tips | Educational | 2-3x per week | Educational section captions |
| Risk management | Educational | Weekly | Text explanation in caption |
| Feature showcase | Product Feature | 1x per week | How-to caption |
| Alert examples | Product Feature | 2x per week | Brief explanation |
| Beta announcements | Announcement | As needed | Waitlist CTA text |
| Launch news | Announcement | Major milestones | Launch post caption |
| New features | Announcement | When shipping | Feature details in caption |

### Recommended Mix
- **70% Text-Only** - Use captions from SOCIAL_MEDIA_POSTS.md as-is
- **30% Visual** - Create custom images using these templates for high-impact posts

This keeps your feed fresh, diverse, and not overly "designed" (which can feel less authentic).

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Batch Content Creation:** Edit all three templates at once for the week, then generate all images together

2. **Seasonal Variations:** Update colors slightly for holidays (keep brand consistency but add seasonal touches)

3. **A/B Testing:** Create two versions of the same content with different headlines to see what performs better

4. **Reuse Templates:** Save your best-performing edits as separate HTML files (e.g., `post-educational-monday-motivation.html`)

5. **Keep it Fresh:** Rotate between all three templates to keep your feed visually interesting

6. **Pair with SOCIAL_MEDIA_POSTS.md:** Use the ready-to-post content from that document, then create matching visuals with these templates
